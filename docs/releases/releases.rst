Augur Releases & Upgrading
==========================

To make an omelette, you have to break some eggs.
To keep improving and adding to ``augur`` and ``auspice``, we sometimes have
to break old code!

We know these kinds of changes can be really frustrating for users -
things that used to work suddenly don't. Finding out what went wrong
and learning what you need to change should be as pain-free as possible.

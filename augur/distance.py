"""Calculate the distance between sequences across entire genes or at a predefined subset of sites.

Distance calculations require selection of a comparison method (to determine
which sequences to compare) and a distance map (to determine the weight of a
mismatch between any two sequences).

Comparison methods
==================

Comparison methods include:

#. root: the root and all nodes in the tree (the previous default for all distances)
#. ancestor: each tip from a current season and its immediate ancestor (optionally, from a previous season)
#. pairwise: all tips pairwise (optionally, all tips from a current season against all tips in previous seasons)

Ancestor and pairwise comparisons can be calculated with or without information
about the current season. When no dates are provided, the ancestor comparison
calculates the distance between each tip and its immediate ancestor in the given
tree. Similarly, the pairwise comparison calculates the distance between all
pairs of tips in the tree.

When the user provides a "latest date", all tips sampled after that date belong
to the current season and all tips sampled on that date or prior belong to
previous seasons. When this information is available, the ancestor comparison
calculates the distance between each tip in the current season and its last
ancestor from a previous season. The pairwise comparison only calculates the
distances between tips in the current season and those from previous
seasons.

When the user also provides an "earliest date", pairwise comparisons exclude
tips sampled from previous seasons prior to the given date. These two date
parameters allow users to specify a fixed time interval for pairwise
calculations, limiting the computationally complexity of the comparisons.

Distance maps
=============

Distance maps are defined in JSON format with two required top-level keys.
The `default` key specifies the numeric (floating point) value to assign to all mismatches by default.
The `map` key specifies a dictionary of weights to use for distance calculations.
These weights are indexed hierarchically by gene name and one-based gene coordinate and are assigned in either a sequence-independent or sequence-dependent manner.
The simplest possible distance map calculates Hamming distance between sequences without any site-specific weights, as shown below::

    {
        "name": "Hamming distance",
        "default": 1,
        "map": {}
    }

By default, distances are floating point values whose precision can be controlled with the `precision` key that defines the number of decimal places to retain for each distance.
The following example shows how to specify a precision of two decimal places in the final output.::

    {
        "name": "Hamming distance",
        "default": 1,
        "map": {},
        "precision": 2
    }

Distances can be reported as integer values by specifying an `output_type` as `integer` or `int` as follows.::

    {
        "name": "Hamming distance",
        "default": 1,
        "map": {},
        "output_type": "integer"
    }

Sequence-independent distances are defined by gene and position using a numeric
value of the same type as the default value (integer or float). The following
example is a distance map for antigenic amino acid substitutions near influenza
A/H3N2 HA's receptor binding sites. This map calculates the Hamming distance
between amino acid sequences only at seven positions in the HA1 gene::

    {
        "name": "Koel epitope sites",
        "default": 0,
        "map": {
            "HA1": {
                "145": 1,
                "155": 1,
                "156": 1,
                "158": 1,
                "159": 1,
                "189": 1,
                "193": 1
            }
        }
    }

Sequence-dependent distances are defined by gene, position, and sequence pairs
where the `from` sequence in each pair is interpreted as the ancestral state and
the `to` sequence as the derived state. The following example is a distance map
that assigns asymmetric weights to specific amino acid substitutions at a
specific position in the influenza gene HA1::

    {
        "default": 0.0,
        "map": {
           "HA1": {
               "112": [
                   {
                       "from": "V",
                       "to": "I",
                       "weight": 1.192
                   },
                   {
                       "from": "I",
                       "to": "V",
                       "weight": 0.002
                   }
               ]
           }
       }
    }

The distance command produces a JSON output file in standard "node data" format
that can be passed to `augur export`. In addition to the standard `nodes` field,
the JSON includes a `params` field that describes the mapping of attribute names
to requested comparisons and distance maps and any date parameters specified by
the user. The following example JSON shows a sample output when the distance
command is run with multiple comparisons and distance maps::

    {
        "params": {
            "attributes": ["ep", "ne", "ne_star", "ep_pairwise"],
            "compare_to": ["root", "root", "ancestor", "pairwise"],
            "map_name": [
                "wolf_epitope",
                "wolf_nonepitope",
                "wolf_nonepitope",
                "wolf_epitope"
            ],
            "latest_date": "2009-10-01"
        },
        "nodes": {
            "A/Afghanistan/AF1171/2008": {
                "ep": 7,
                "ne": 6,
                "ne_star": 1,
                "ep_pairwise": {
                    "A/Aichi/78/2007": 1,
                    "A/Argentina/3509/2006": 2
                }

  Validating 'x.fasta'â€¦
  WARNING: Metadata merge was successful but sequence merge has failed, so --output-metadata has no corresponding sequence output.
  ERROR: Sequence ids must be unique.
  
  The following ids were duplicated in 'x.fasta':
  
    seq2
    seq3
  
  [2]

  $ cat merged.fasta

Duplicate checking can be skipped, however it will lead to dropping of all but
the first entry, which is at odds with the approach used for the rest of
augur merge. This behavior is a reflection of the seqkit rmdup internals.
